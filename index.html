        <h3>The Story</h3>
        <blockquote>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
            around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villager">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This
                is most
            unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild
                horses with
                it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villager">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of
                events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>

            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke
            his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="villager">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,</q>
            and the
            farmer
            responded, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript
            people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came
            around and said, <q class="villager">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer">Maybe.</q>

            The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to
            tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> —
                because
                you
                never know
                                                                                    what will be
                the
                                                              consequence
            of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of
            <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</blockquote>

    <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
